<h1>VM Check Ports</h1>
<h3>Help/About</h3>
<p><div>What does this application do?</div>
Allows you to obtain the status of communication ports on content servers on the network. I.e.: 
It informs you if your security camera is accessible for connections from outside your network.

<p><div>How to use this application?</div>
Fill the "Host" field with an IP address or a valid URL and the "Port" field with
a port number between 1 and 65536 and click "check". If the service is
Publicly available, the port will appear as open.

<p><div>Who is this application for?</div>
It is useful for IT professionals and electronic security technicians.

<p><div>It informs that the service port is closed or that there is no response, but I'm sure the application is incorrect.</div>
This can happen when your own public address is used, since not all routers allow NAT loopback. Try using one of these 
online services when this happens: <a href="http://www.yougetsignal.com/tools/open-ports">you get signal</a> or
<a href="http://www.whatsmyip.org/port-scanner">what is my IP</a>

<!-- Only for java software
<p><div>What does the "Try paste from clipboard" function do?</div>
This function tries to find out if there is any associated IP address or URL and port to the contents of the transfer area, 
placing them in the appropriate field.

<p><div>Who made this application?</div>

security professional and passionate about Information systems.
